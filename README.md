# Laravel Inertia Vue Clean Minimalist Skill

This skill helps build, redesign, and refactor Laravel + Inertia + Vue applications with:

- TypeScript-first frontend practices
- Backend/frontend contract alignment
- Clean Laravel architecture (`FormRequest`, `ApiResource`, strict types, services + DTOs)
- `pnpm` package-management consistency
- Laravel/Vue security best practices
- UX-first delivery (ease of use prioritized over visual decoration)

## UI Style Modes

- `minimalist`: Calm, restrained, high-signal interface
- `informative`: Data-dense, maximum clarity, dashboard-friendly interface

The skill always prioritizes usability and UX best practices before visual polish.
